        <p><h4>In the beginning</h4>Ali and I attended a one day workshop called "Unix and Git for Everyone" (which no longer exists). We thought this would be a good place to start. Unfortunately, we were expecting a traditional 'instructor-student' structure but what we found was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_immersion" target=_blank>'immersion' teaching</a>. Code Fellows calls it <a href="http://www.codefellows.org/blog/how-to-accelerate-your-learning-with-stacked-modules" target=_blank>"stacked modules"</a>. We were <strong>SO</strong> ill-prepared. It was a struggle but we eventually completed the requirements. That taught us what to expect in the future. <strong>The key is the pre-work and to keep pushing forward.</strong></p> The next step was learning to work on Macs instead of Windows PC which is OK. These days it's probably good to be multi-platform adept.</p>

        <p><h4>Foundations I: August 3 - 27, 2015</h4>We learned a lot in just eight 2-hour classes (which included countless hours of self-study). Code Fellows has a lot of room for improvement which it appears they are addressing now. The two 2 hour classes per week are simply too short. (There will be two 3 hour classes plus a full weekend day per week in the future.) By the time the instructor gets rolling on something it's time to end the class and the assignment is announced in a big rush. Improvements could also be made in the way the syllabus is presented on the website. The details are spread around making it difficult to get a clear understanding of what to expect. Hopefully they'll continue working on that as well. All things considered, I think we got our moneys worth.
        </p>
        <p>We noticed several students were not prepared. Either they didn't review the syllabus or complete the pre-work, or both. I heard one person ask why we weren't using Dreamweaver. The instructor expressed some frustration not knowing how to better communicate this information before the course begins.</p>
        <p>Near the end of the class we were privy to the new Code Fellows course structure which will be released on Friday, August 28th. This is a welcome change because now it will be an actual "learning track" rather than the very loose structure it has been. The Foundations I course we just completed will soon cease to exist.

        <p><h4>Code 201: October 27 - December 20, 2015</h4>
        <h4>We're the first!</h4>Because Code Fellows changed their course structure we modified our original plans and transferred into the new track. We are part of the first batch of students that are on this path which means there are sure to be a few bumps along the way. As expected, the beginning of the class is review of the same material we were exposed to in Foundation I, however, the instructor is going into much more detailed explanations. This is very helpful.</p>
        <p>UPDATE: November 29, 2015</p>
        <p>We're over half-way through the course and things are really starting to make sense now. I only wish the assignments were published and graded in a more timely manner. It's been 10 days since the last assignment was due. Ali and I have continued working on different coding solutions hoping our work will match what the future assignments will be.</p>
        <p>UPDATE: December 17, 2015</p>
        <p>The class has been divided into groups with each group working on a project of their choice. Ali and I are our own 'group' and our final project is close to completion. It feels good to be able to design and code a functional app. This has been a much more worthwhile experience than the old Foundations 1 course was.
        <p>UPDATE: December 20, 2015</p>
        <p>During our final 201 class we presented our final projects. We're very impressed with what the other students in this class have produced. This is a creative and hard-working group. We'll have to step-up our game before starting 301.</p>
